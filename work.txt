the toys upfront is added in backend also connected to orbit 
I'll help you verify that the toys upfront template is properly added to the backend and connected to Orbit. Let me check the current status and configuration.
Let me check the current backend configuration and verify the toys upfront integration:
Explored
2 files
Now let me check the toys template to verify it's connected to the backend:
Explored
2 files 1 directory
Now let me check if the toys template is properly configured with the backend connection:
Explored
1 file
Let me check the context file to see how it's integrated:
Explored
2 files 1 directory
Now let me check if the layout uses the StorefrontProvider:
Read
layout.tsx
Let me check if there's a .env file in the toys template:
Run in terminal
cd "d:\orbit\templates\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2" && dir .env*
Terminal Output
Now let me check the backend routes to see if the storefront API is properly configured:
Explored
1 file 1 directory

I understand! Let me check the current status and verify that the toys upfront template is properly connected to the backend and Orbit system. Based on the documentation I found, it looks like the toys upfront template has already been integrated, but let me verify the current setup.
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && dir templates\orbit_front_others\toy*
Terminal Output
Good! I can see there are 3 toy templates. Let me check if the toys upfront template has the backend integration files:
Run in terminal
cd "d:\orbit\templates\orbit_front_others\toys upfront" && dir lib context
Terminal Output
Excellent! The "toys upfront" template already has the backend integration files:
lib/storefront-api.ts
context/StorefrontContext.tsx
Now let me check if it's properly configured in the layout:
Read
layout.tsx
Perfect! The toys upfront template is already properly integrated with:
✅ StorefrontProvider in the layout
✅ Backend API integration files
✅ Context management
Let me also check if there's a .env file configured:
Run in terminal
cd "d:\orbit\templates\orbit_front_others\toys upfront" && dir .env*
Terminal Output
Let me check if the backend is running and test the connection:
Explored
1 terminal
see on this i want you to connect it with orbit and the admin  and make other upfronts in root same implementation
see on this i want you to connect it with orbit and the admin  and make other upfronts in root same implementation
I understand! You want me to:
Connect the "toys upfront" template with Orbit and Admin
Apply the same implementation to all other upfront templates in the root
Let me first check the current status and then implement the full integration. Let me examine what needs to be done:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && dir templates
Terminal Output
Now let me check what templates exist in the root directory that need to be integrated:
Explored
1 terminal
dont use template folders use upfronts in root
dont use template folders use upfronts in root
I understand! You want me to work with the upfront templates that are in the root directory, not in the templates folder. Let me check what upfront directories exist in the root:
Perfect! I can see the upfront directories in the root. Let me identify all the upfront templates that need to be integrated:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && dir *Upfront* /AD && dir *upfront* /AD
Terminal Output
Let me also check the other directories:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && dir orbit*upfront* /AD
Terminal Output
Let me also check the orbit_front_others directory:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && dir orbit_front_others
Terminal Output
Great! Now I have a clear picture. Let me create a plan to connect all these upfront templates with Orbit and Admin:
Add To-dos
Verify toys upfront template is properly connected to backend and Orbit-360
Create .env.local files for all upfront templates with proper backend connection settings
Integrate Electronics_upfront_2 with backend API and Orbit connection
Integrate electronics_Upfront_3 with backend API and Orbit connection
Integrate Jewellery_Upfront with backend API and Orbit connection
Integrate Jewellery_Upfront_2 with backend API and Orbit connection
Integrate orbit-cosmetics-upfront with backend API and Orbit connection
Integrate orbit_upfront with backend API and Orbit connection
Integrate all fashion upfront templates (fashion upfront, fashion_upfront_2, fashion upfront 3) with backend
Integrate FOOTWEAR UPFRONT with backend API and Orbit connection
Test all integrated templates to ensure they connect properly with backend and Orbit
Now let me start implementing the integration. First, let me verify the current toys upfront connection:
Updated To-dos
Let me check the current toys upfront template to see what's already connected:
Explored
1 file
I see the issue - I was looking in the wrong directory. Let me check the correct toys upfront directory:
Run in terminal
cd "d:\orbit\orbit_front_others\toys upfront" && dir lib context
Terminal Output
I see that the "toys upfront" template in the root doesn't have the backend integration files yet. Let me check what templates already have the integration by looking at the working toy template:
Run in terminal
cd "d:\orbit\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2" && dir lib context
Terminal Output
It seems none of the root upfront templates have the backend integration yet. Let me check if there's a working template I can copy from. Let me look at the templates folder:
Run in terminal
cd "d:\orbit\templates\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2" && dir lib context
Terminal Output
Perfect! I found the working template with the backend integration. Now I'll copy these files to all the root upfront templates. Let me start by creating the .env.local files for all templates:
Updated To-dos
Let me create the .env.local files for all upfront templates:

Great! Now let me start integrating the templates. I'll begin with the electronics templates since they're in the root:
Updated To-dos
Let me copy the integration files from the working template to Electronics_upfront_2:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && xcopy "templates\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2\lib\storefront-api.ts" "Electronics_upfront_2\lib\" /Y
Terminal Output
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && xcopy "templates\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2\context\StorefrontContext.tsx" "Electronics_upfront_2\context\" /Y
Terminal Output
Now I need to update the layout file to include the StorefrontProvider. Let me check the current layout:
Explored
1 file
Let me check the correct path structure:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit\Electronics_upfront_2 && dir /s layout.tsx
Terminal Output
I see the structure is different. Let me check the actual layout file:
Read
layout.tsx
Now I need to add the StorefrontProvider. Let me update this layout file:
‎layout.tsx

Applied
I need to move the context files to the correct location. Let me check the current structure and move the files:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit\Electronics_upfront_2 && mkdir context
Terminal Output
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit\Electronics_upfront_2 && mkdir lib
Terminal Output
The directories already exist. Let me copy the files to the correct location within the theme directory:
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && xcopy "templates\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2\lib\storefront-api.ts" "Electronics_upfront_2\electronics-upfront-theme-2\src\lib\" /Y
Terminal Output
Run in terminal
cd d:\orbit && xcopy "templates\orbit_front_others\toy upfront 2\context\StorefrontContext.tsx" "Electronics_upfront_2\electronics-upfront-theme-2\src\context\" /Y
Terminal Output
Now let me update the layout to wrap the providers correctly:
‎layout.tsx
