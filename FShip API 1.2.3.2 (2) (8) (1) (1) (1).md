3  INTRODUCTION  Using the   FShip   API guide, developers can integrate our customer delivery platform into their  applications. The API is designed to allow application developers for:  •   Courier Management  Get Courier List  •   Warehouse Management  Add Warehouse   Update Warehouse  •   Manage Order  Create Forward Order   Create Reverse Order   Cancel Order  Shipping Labels   Track Orders   -   Tracking History, Latest Status  •   Rate Calculator  •   Pincode Serviceability Check  Type of Operations  •   Forward Operations   –   Orders that are originating at client warehouse or seller side and are  to be delivered to end customer.  •   Reverse Operations   –   Return orders that are originating at customer side and are to be  delivered or returned to client warehouse or seller.  Termino logy  •   AWB   –   Also known as waybill number or airwaybill number is unique tracking number  which is obtained when any order is successfully placed within   FShip   system.  •   Order Id   –   Unique Order Id is given to every order within   FShip   System for references.  •   Au thentication   –   Each   FShip   API request requires an Authentication Token called as  signature , to process your API request in our system. You will be shared Staging and  Production API keys/signature from the   FShip   Team.  •   Environments  Staging/Sandbox  URL   –   https://capi - qc.fship.in  Swagger URL   –   https://capi - qc.fship.in /swagger/index.html  Security   Key   –   085c36066064af83c66b9dbf44d190d40feec79f437bc1c1cb  Production  URL   –   https://capi.fship.in  Swagger URL   –   https://capi.fship.in /swagger/index.html  Security Key   Obtained from   –   Settings   >   API   Details >   Client   Key  •   All our API is REST - based which means:

4     It makes use of standard HTTP verbs like GET, POST      The   API   uses   standard  HTTP error responses to describe errors.     Authentication is specified with HTTP Token Authentication.     POST data should be encoded as standard application/json  •   Response   –   FShip   API uses HTTP status codes to indicate the status of your requests. This  includes successful and unsuccessful responses. All responses are in JSON by default.  o   Status Codes     200   -   OK: Everything went as planned.     400   -   Bad Request: You did something wrong. Often a missing argument or parameter.     401   -   Unauthorized: Authentication was incorrect.     404   -   Not Found     500   -   Internal Server Error: We had a problem processing the request .     503   -   Service Unavailable: Try again later.

Users can   also  add multiple pickup locations using Warehouse creation API. Each address is assigned with  unique   address id , (can be find in   FShip   Dashboard under   Manage Warehouse ) which will be  use while order creation. This usually comes under advance integration,   and hence before  creating an order, the client warehouse needs to be created in our system.  Note:  •   Integration of this API is completely optional, as the same can be created using   FShip  Dashboard. But if the business use case demands dynamic pickup locations addition,  then this API is good to integrate with.  •   The pickup address will be also be registered as return address, by default.
